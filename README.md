# Welcome to my blog.
This site is written in raw html/css, no framework, no backend, no database,
nothing complicated.

I've created this blog to relearn web development. As I
learn more, I'll turn my notes into articles, develope new features,
and updated the technology stack.

Eventually, this site will have auth, session management, a newsletter, and
several other standard features you'd expect to see on a blog.

Because this is a starter project, IT WILL MOVE to a new location.
